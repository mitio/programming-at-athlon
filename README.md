## Ruby Programming Course

A small and experimental programming course which takes place at Athlon Sofia. This repo contains:

- notes and resources from each meetup
- homework assignments
- solutions and unit tests for the assignments

The course is taught by [me](http://ddimitrov.name) and shares some resources from [fmi.ruby.bg](http://fmi.ruby.bg).
